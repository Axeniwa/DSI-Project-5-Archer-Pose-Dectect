# DSI-Project-5-Archer-Pose-Dectect

The idea is to collect coordinates for each body parts of a master archer shooting an arrow, so as to train a machine learning model to determine a range of correct movements. Lastly implementing the model on a real time smart phone app, to correct shooting posture of the user.

Wading through a swamp of frustration of getting things to work (A2J,tensorflow js posenet, detectron2,keras,pytorch,wechat projects), I finally found a pose detect package that worked on my video, and returned a set of body part coordinates. I would like to thank the author of that script, whose content I regrettably can longer find.

I did not have enough time to progress beyond this point.
