# DSI-Project-5-Archer-Pose-Dectect

The idea is to collect coordinates for each body parts of a master archer shooting an arrow, so as to train a machine learning model to determine a range of correct movements. Lastly implementing the model on a real time smart phone app, to correct shooting posture of the user.

Wading through a swamp of frustration of trying out numerous scripts, I finally found a pose detect package that worked on my video, and returned a set of body part coordinates. I did not have enough time to progress beyond that point.
